# online-edu-care

In the project directory=>

- I just tried to make an online programming language learning site.
- I Made a faka JSON file with some courses, mentors, durations, course prices, review and so on.
- Although, I tried to make this site routeable without reloading which is the first priyority for making SPA.

You can also visit our live site by clicking <a target="_blank" href="https://online-edu-care.netlify.app/"> here </a> .
